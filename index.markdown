I've worked in the advertising / branding / marketing industry in various capacities as a designer, production designer and art director. I love working with awesome teams and executing great creative, whether it's digital production for social media, web animation and banners, or complex print jobs. 

Specialties: Adobe CC (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere & After Effects), Figma, HTML/CSS, GSAP, Print Production and Motion Graphics.
